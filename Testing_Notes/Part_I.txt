----------------------Final Notes---------------------------
Any design notes on motion and game style would be best now while its easy to change. If anything is too difficult please note it, its only the first part of the game it shouldn't be that bad (except maybe the boss). Levels should be traversable in both directions (although may be much harder backwards).
