Because I am lazy I am just going to write out new feature list instead of a list of things that should work with them

Cloud Boss both parts
Entrance to tower after cloud boss
Secret room 1 (down path)
Difficulties (save points)
Color boss difficulty differences
Cloud boss part 1 difficulty differences
Main menu 
File selection menu
Three save files one for each difficulty
File open menu
pause menu (hit p)
more achievements (mostly just for beating the bosses and difficulties)
only reading input when active window and pauses game when losing focus


Known bugs:
 FIXED -- Bounce when dropping through vertical platforms that are descending
    
 FIXED -- If holding down when landing on a color switch the switch does not activate
 FIXED -- if on a platform when color boss dies you stay there
 FIXED?-- wall kick platforms sometime flash at the bottom when moving the level
 FIXED -- if you grab an extra and then quit you have the extra when returning

-------------------Unfinished Features-------------------------
 -- filling of slopes
 -- hints throughout the bottom path
 -- hint for wall kicking and moving against the motion
 -- achievements are only a template for now
 -- orange boxes will fade in and out instead of just appearing


Final Notes:
