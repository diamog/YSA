----------------------Final Notes---------------------------
I want feedback on ratings of the bosses. If there are 4 difficulties, easy, medium, hard, impossible, how would you rate them. There will most likely be 2-3 versions per boss based on difficulty setting.

Refer to previous notes for details on features in release 0.1 and 0.1.5
