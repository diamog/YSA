----------------------Known Bugs------------------------
 -- Bounce when dropping through vertical platforms that are descending
 -- If holding down when landing on a color switch the switch does not activate
 -- if on a platform when color boss dies you stay there
 -- wall kick platforms sometime flash at the bottom when moving the level

-----------------------Hidden Bugs-----------------------
 --These are not fixed but should not appear due to change in orders or other hacks
 * Landing on vertically stacked platforms
 * Teleporting if trying to drop through a platform that has the same x,width as a thin platform
 * while dropping through thin platforms moving through the platform adjacent to the thin platform

-------------------Unfinished Features-------------------------
 -- filling of slopes
 -- hints throughout the bottom path
 -- hint for wall kicking and moving against the motion
 -- achievements are only a template for now
 -- orange boxes will fade in and out instead of just appearing

----------------------Final Notes---------------------------
I want feedback on ratings of the bosses. If there are 4 difficulties, easy, medium, hard, impossible, how would you rate them. There will most likely be 2-3 versions per boss based on difficulty setting.
